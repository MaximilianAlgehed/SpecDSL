# List of issues

1. How to efficiently and uniformly
   sample a list of ranges [(a,a)]?
   I suspect lazyness will play a _big_
   role in getting this right.

2. How to easily make it extensible?
   I think that an approach like the
   operational-alacarte etc. could
   be really cool, but maybe very very overkill.

3. How can the approach of RSet be generalized,
   is a fold of a monotonic function (in the FEAT)
   sense a monotonic function?
