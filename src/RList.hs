Module      :  Data.RangeSet.List
Description :  A trivial implementation of range sets
Copyright   :  (c) Oleg Grenrus 2014

Maintainer  :  oleg.grenrus@iki.fi
Stability   :  experimental
Portability :  non-portable (tested with GHC only)

A trivial implementation of range sets.

This module is intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name
clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.

>  import Data.RangeSet.List (RSet)
>  import qualified Data.RangeSet.List as RSet

The implementation of 'RSet' is based on /list/.

Compared to 'Data.Set', this module imposes also 'Enum' restriction for many
functions.  We must be able to identify consecutive elements to be able to
/glue/ and /split/ ranges properly.

The implementation assumes that

> x < succ x
> pred x < x

and there aren't elements in between (not true for 'Float' and 'Double').  Also
'succ' and 'pred' are never called for largest or smallest value respectively.
