# Exempel

* Pizza example,
  in erlang!

* Very basic example in haskell

* Steal examples from old papers

* Motivating example

* Run with erlang
    * We need to have an idle erlang node
      started waiting to run a process, rather
      than starting a new node every time.
      Starting the node seems waaay overkill.

* Game - Labyrinth
    * Graphcs?
    * Linear logic?
