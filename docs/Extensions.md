# Extensions

* Predicate -> Finite Domain CP -> Generator

* More sophisticated test data generation
    * This may mean we need a fixpoint operator
      as we _may_ need to keep track of
      the length of the shortest path in a branch.

* JS backend

* Combined syntax for SessionTypes + Predicates

* Polymorphic session types + Session types with channels etc.

* Tesing monadic code at the same time as testing protocols, maybe?

* Linear logic in the predicate language, it would be good to have
  a concept of limited resources. One simple example is a web-shop
  where you enter a coupon with say, 100kr on it.
