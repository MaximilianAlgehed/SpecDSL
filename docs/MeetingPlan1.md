# Meeting plan for 2016-08-03

* Demonstration of the current progress

* Discuss the facets of a user-friendly DSL for predicates

* Discuss examples, we need more of them...
  We may even need a very flashy example,
  it would be nice to have one that talks to
  a web-browser or something.

* Discuss demonstration slides
